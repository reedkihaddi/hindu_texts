**यतो धर्मस्ततो जयः**

This is an attempt to visualize and find interesting information about the sacred books. I have scraped all the shlokas along with the English translations of each shloka. There is wordcloud and a graph of number of verses for each Kanda in Ramayana. 

This is an ongoing project that I'll contribute to more in the future.
